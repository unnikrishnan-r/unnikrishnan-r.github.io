# Bootstrap-Portfolio-FSF-HW2
Creating a portfolio using bootstrap. Full Stack Flex UoFt Bootcamp - Assignment on Bootstrap

This project is to create a personal portfolio using the [Bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework and limit use of media queries.

The base layout of the portfolio is a reuse of the previous project - [Basic Portfolio Using HTML & CSS](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-r/Basic-Portfolio_FSF_HW)

The portfolio has been recreated using Bootstrap with an intention to minimize use of media queries.

## Approach followed for Styling:
1. Font Awesome for Icons
2. Bootstrap for the Basic framework
3. commonstyles.css (custom) for overriding styles from Bootsrap and applicable to all screen resolutions
4. styles.css (custom) - specific styles for screens with resolution > 1024px only

## Use of Javascript

1. Toggle in Navbar to work
2. Tooltip when hovering over Icons in contact page to work

## Bootstrap Features Used:
1. Responsive Navbar with Toggle
2. Grid System with predefined widths
3. Sticky Footer
4. Use of tooltip (on icons instead of buttons)
5. Form groups
6. Responsive Images
7. Flex
